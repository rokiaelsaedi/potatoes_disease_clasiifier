# Potato Disease Classifier

This project aims to help farmers identify potato diseases using deep learning. The **Potato Disease Classifier** uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify various potato diseases based on leaf images.

## Project Overview

The system includes:
- **CNN Model**: Trained to classify images of potato leaves into different disease categories.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides an API for serving real-time predictions.
- **Frontend**: A simple and user-friendly web interface created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Upload a potato leaf image to predict the disease.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy access and use.
- **FastAPI Server**: A scalable backend for fast and efficient predictions.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for serving predictions.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the web interface.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter, PyCharm, VS Code, Postman.
